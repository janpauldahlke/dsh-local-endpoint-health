/**
 * Shared pane-open state for the slot-health surfaces. The dock chip and the
 * rightbar tab are registered once and coexist; each decides its own
 * visibility from this flag instead of swapping slots.
 *
 * `SlotBody` reports its mount/unmount here (mount == the rightbar tab holding
 * the slot-health pane is open). The dock chip hides itself while the open
 * count is greater than zero — reference-counted so a second open pane (e.g. a
 * second Session with the slot-health tab) does not reappear when one of them
 * closes.
 * Module-level like the live store: no React dependency, works at 1 Hz.
